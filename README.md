- `Presentation/` <br>
    Contains the presentation decks used for proposal and final presentations.
- `Trials and experimentation/` <br>
    Contains Jupyter Notebooks that we wrote over the course of working on this project. These contain experiments, trials and their results, some of which failed. The final notebooks were built atop the ideas and approaches that were explored via these rough notebooks.

## Kaggle API Key

The dataset is directly downloaded from Kaggle using the Kaggle CLI. This requires an API key to be generated and used in **all** of our notebooks. We have added placeholder values for Kaggle username and API keys in the first cell of our notebooks which must be edited before running.
